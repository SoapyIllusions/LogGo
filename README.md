## LoGo Readme

** Currently a work in Progress, not yet usable **

When complete will provide a web interface which allows users to:

* Add files to watcher with a few clicks
* Live indexing of all watched files
* Search through all watched files
* Provide results using Socket.IO to see them as the parser finds them
